      ### Multi-field Coupling Mechanics of Soft Matter
      *Multi-field coupling mechanics* investigates how soft materials respond and evolve under the simultaneous action of multiple physical fields—mechanical loading, thermal fluctuations, electric/magnetic stimuli, and fluidic transport.

      When these fields interact, they drive **morphological evolution**, induce **damage and failure**, and reshape the **constitutive relations** that govern material behavior. This is crucial for **biological tissues** and **engineered soft systems** (electroactive polymers, soft robots, responsive gels).

      **Key questions**
      - How do coupled thermal/electrical/fluidic fields influence morphology?
      - What are the damage and failure mechanisms under multi-field loading?
      - How to build constitutive models capturing nonlinear, history-dependent coupling?
      - Can we exploit coupling for **programmable/adaptive** functionalities?
