      ### Mechanical Principles of Soft Tissue Development
      *Soft tissue development mechanics* explores how tissues grow, deform, and reorganize under the combined influence of mechanical and biochemical cues.  
      
      These processes involve **cross-scale mechanical mechanisms**—from molecular interactions to tissue-level morphogenesis—and the **synergistic coupling** of forces (stretching, compression, shear) with biochemical signals (growth factors, morphogens). Such interplay regulates **morphological evolution**, directs **cell fate and patterning**, and underlies fundamental life processes such as **embryonic development**, **wound healing**, and **disease progression**.

      Understanding these mechanisms is essential for both **basic biology** and **biomedical engineering**, including applications in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and disease modeling.

      **Key questions**
      - How do multiscale mechanical forces shape tissue architecture during development?  
      - What are the synergistic mechanisms between mechanical loading and biochemical signaling?  
      - How do cells integrate mechanical and biochemical cues to guide differentiation and morphogenesis?  
      - Can we exploit these couplings to design **bioengineered tissues** with programmable developmental trajectories?
