      ### Pattern formation of soft materials
      Pattern formation of soft materials explore how patterns of soft materials and elastic structures emerge from elastic instability, phase transition and multi-physical coupling mechanisms

      **Key questions**
      - What's the mechanism under different pattern formation of soft materials?
      - Can we exploit these mechanism for programmable/adaptive functionalities?
