# Abstract
abstract: |
  This study explores how cell fate in intestinal crypt formation is influenced by mechano-osmotic forces, providing insights into tissue morphogenesis and the role of mechanical cues in development.

# Summary (shortened abstract)
summary: |
  Mechano-osmotic forces play a critical role in coordinating cell fate decisions during intestinal crypt formation, with implications for tissue development and regeneration.
