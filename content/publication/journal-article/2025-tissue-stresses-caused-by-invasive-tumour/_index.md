# Abstract
abstract: |
  This biomechanical model investigates the tissue stresses caused by invasive tumors, offering insights into the mechanical effects of tumors on surrounding tissue and their role in cancer progression.

# Summary (shortened abstract)
summary: |
  This study explores tissue stresses induced by invasive tumors and presents a biomechanical model for understanding tumor-host interactions.
