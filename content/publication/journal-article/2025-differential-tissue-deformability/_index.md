# Abstract
abstract: |
  Differential tissue deformability plays a crucial role in fluid pressure-driven shape divergence during brain and spinal cord development in avian embryos. This study explores how tissue mechanics contribute to embryonic development.

# Summary (shortened abstract)
summary: |
  Tissue deformability plays a key role in the fluid pressure-driven divergence of shape in the developing avian brain and spinal cord.
